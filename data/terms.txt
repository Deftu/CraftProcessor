This server uses the $NAME bot to help handle Minecraft crashes and logs. It will remove as much sensitive information as it can and upload it to a [Hastebin](https://hastebin.com/about.md) server to make it easier to view. The bot will also collect information to improve itself and make yours and other users' experience significantly better.

Sending a log or crash report to this bot or to this server constitutes consent to the collection of information described above. To opt-out of this behaviour, you can disable the bot's functionality in your config with `/config`.
