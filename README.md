# [`CraftProcessor`]
The ultimate Minecraft log helper.

</div>

## What is it?

CraftProcessor is a Minecraft log helper that
allows you to easily parse and analyze Minecraft
logs. It will try to find the most relevant information
for you, and will also provide you with potential solutions
to problems you may encounter or that you may not even know
you have. It will also censor out any potentially sensitive
information in your logs and provide a clean copy of it inside
a cross-platform readable Hastebin paste.

## Why would I use it?

In a lot of ways, it can automate your support process if
you're a mod developer, or help you out with any issues while
modding Minecraft if you're a player. It's 100% free and open
source, with no catch. You can use it for any purpose you want.
The solutions it provides are entirely community driven and
are always open to discussion.

## Can I use it in my server?

Of course! It's 100% free and public! [Click here][invite] if you'd
like to invite it.

## What if I want to contribute?

If you'd like to contribute to the project's data files or provide
a solution to an issue, there are markdown documentation files for
each file in the data directory. If you'd like to head there and
check it out, [click here](/data).

If you'd like to contribute to the bot source itself, feel free to
make a fork and make any changes you see fit. Please remember to follow
the project's licensing ([GPL 3][gpl3]) when doing so. Once you're done,
create a pull request and make a ticket in the [Discord server][discord]
